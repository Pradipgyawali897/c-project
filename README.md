<h1 style="text-align:center;">ðŸŽ® C Project: SDL2-Based Chat Client & Server ðŸ’¬</h1>

<p align="center">
  A real-time messaging application built using C, SDL2, and Windows Sockets. This project brings together low-level networking with a graphical user interface to simulate a simple but interactive client-server chat system.

<h2>ðŸ§  Project Description</h2>
<p>
This project is a real-time chat application written in C that showcases the power of integrating multimedia libraries with network communication. It consists of two parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client:</strong> A graphical interface powered by SDL2 where users can type and send messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Server:</strong> A background console program that handles multiple client connections and message routing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Messages are sent over TCP using Windows Sockets, and the client displays them using SDL_ttf fonts on a custom background. Notifications are enhanced with sound effects, and all chat history is logged for future reference.
</p>

<h2>âœ¨ Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interactive GUI:</strong> Clean SDL2 interface with background image and custom fonts.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Messaging:</strong> Chat system using TCP sockets for instant communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Sound Alerts:</strong> Receive audio notifications every time a message arrives.</li>
  <li><strong>Chat Logging:</strong> Messages are stored locally in a history file.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-User Support:</strong> The server can manage connections from multiple clients.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient Networking:</strong> Uses <code>ws2_32</code> for robust Windows socket programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸš§ Under the Hood</h2>
<p>
The core of the application combines Câ€™s performance with the flexibility of SDL2â€™s multimedia capabilities. By blending text rendering, image display, and sound with classic socket programming, the project provides an engaging desktop-based communication system â€” all from scratch in C.
